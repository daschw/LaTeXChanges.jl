Julia is  my favourite programming language.
We want to test \LaTeX files also containing {\textit curved brackets}.
Some changes might even wrap around multiple lines.
This should be tested as well.
We should also include equations, so let us add replace one defintion of Euler's constant $e$ by another.
\begin{align}
e = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}
\end{align}
