Julia is \deleted{one of} my favourite programming language\deleted[id=RJ]{s}.
We want to test \LaTeX files \added{also containing {\textit curved brackets}.}
Some changes \replaced[id=RJ]{might even wrap around multiple lines.
This should be tested as well}{can be ignored}.
We should also include equations, so let\added[id=RJ]{ u}s add replace one defintion of Euler's constant $e$ by another.
\replaced{\begin{align}
e = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}
\end{align}}{\begin{align}
e = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty } \left( {1 + \frac{1}{n}} \right)^n
\end{align}}
